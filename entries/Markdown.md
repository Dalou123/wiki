## Section 1: Headings

Use from 1 to 6 hash symbols to create headings:
# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading

You can use headings to separate sections.

Here is another section, we are using the heading 2:

## Section 2: the symbols 

* Emphasis, aka italics, with one  *asterisk* or _underscore_ on each side of the word.

* Strong emphasis, aka bold, with two **asterisks** or __underscores__ on each side of the word.

* Combined emphasis with both **asterisks and _underscores_** at the same time.

* Strikethrough uses the < s >< /s > tags (without spaces)  <s>Scratch this.</s>


## Section 3: Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams

You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
